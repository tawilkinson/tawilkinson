  <h2>Last Updated: 24th January 2018</h2>
  <p>I have created this page to give an overview of what I'm up to <em>Now</em>. This is mostly to help me keep to my goals but is also here if people are wondering what I'm up to. </p>
  <h2>Work</h2>
  <p>I'm well settled in my new job and enjoying being back in the capital. A side benefit has been that I am now a contributor to L<a href="http://www.luxurylondon.com/">uxury London</a> where I review restaurants and bars.</p>
  <p>I'm now in full swing on the two podcasts with 11 of HOMT and 17 of Dr Wilko's out as of today. HOMT is a long form discussion with my friend Mike at <a href="http://www.hatofmanythings.com">Hat of Many Things</a>. The other is a short form
    podcast about quality alcohol called <a href="http://www.drwilko.org/">Dr Wilko's Campaign For Better Beverages</a>.</p>
  <h2>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sponge</h2>
  <p>I want to focus more on tech blogs this year. I've recently updated my FreeNas box and been playing with Rust so expect some posts on those when I have the time. I also plan to write some more about podcasting in general to hopefully help out
    other new podcasters who happen across the site.</p>
  <h2>Writing</h2>
  <p>I have fallen behind on my writing. I want to write a few short stories in the next few months and get started properly on my first long story that has been stewing for over a year now and just needs to be put down on the page. This is, sadly,
    still where I am with this due to limited free time.</p>
  <p>Plus ça change!</p>
  <h2>Design</h2>
  <p>I've done <a href="https://tawilkinson.deviantart.com/art/Star-Wars-A-New-Hope-698174275">one minimalist movie poster</a>. When I have some time I will try to do some more.</p>
