I have written a short story called The Ferryman for the [Dually Noted Group Writing Project](https://frictionlit.org/category/frictionlog/dually-noted-dually-noted/). You can find it published over on the [F(r)ictionLit website](https://frictionlit.org/the-ferryman/).

All of the stories in this Spring season were based on the prompt "*When the stars begin to flicker*". Make sure to check out the other stories and poems in the collection, they are all unique and wonderful.
