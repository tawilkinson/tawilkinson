<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_532428">This week I received a lovely gift box of green tea all the way from America! I was told to make an exciting sounding tea lemonade with this but have only had the time to make a normal cup of tea this week. [I also visited the Whittards outlet shop but more on that next week!]</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_532446"><strong>Brewing</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_532455"><em>"1) Boil water. 2) Place one sachet in cup. 3) Pour 8fl oz hot water over sachet. 4) Steep for 3 minutes."</em></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_532459">This is a green tea so milk need not be added. While you are waiting for your tea to brew you can enjoy reading the packaging as I did ("For best karma, please reuse or recycle.")</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_532462"><strong>Colour</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_532471">Pale brown which has more in common with black tea than green tea.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_532474"><strong>Aroma</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_532478">You can smell the mint strongly. It actually reminds me of mint sauce. This might sound odd for a tea but does help bring to mind the memory of delicious roast lamb.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_532481"><strong>Taste</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_532485">I am happy to report it doesn't taste of mint sauce :) There is a strong mint flavour with a hint of lemon grass (a pleasant aftertaste). There is also an underlying taste of tea :) I couldn't taste the lemon essence but it probably helps bring out the other flavours.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_532488"><strong>Fantasia</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_532492">I took a break from writing my Continuation Report (the reason this entry is so late!) to try this tea. I've been trying to find familiar films/series to watch which are conducive to the writing process and Fantasia has been one of the best yet [I've written 7 pages today :)].</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_532495"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_532499">An invigorating green tea which tastes strongly of mint.</p>
