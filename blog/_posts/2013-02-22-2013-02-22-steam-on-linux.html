<p>Steam is now <a target="_blank" href="http://store.steampowered.com/news/9951/">officially supported</a> on Linux! I decided to try it out.</p>
<h3>Hold your horses!</h3>
<p>Firstly - there are only <a target="_blank" href="http://store.steampowered.com/browse/linux/">78 games supported</a>* at the moment. So just be aware some of your faves might not be there yet.</p>
<p>Secondly - if you are running an Nvidia card you need to have x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers version 304.4 or higher installed. Steam will install but it won't get past login if you don't do this. You can solve this on Gentoo quite simply:</p>
<ul><li>emerge x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers -avuDN</li></ul>
<p>*Though I had 14 of them thanks to Humble Bundles.</p>
<h3>Layman</h3>
<p>Currently Steam isn't included in the main <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/portage/">Portage</a> tree. You're going to need an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/userguide.xml">overlay</a> and the easy way to do this on Gentoo is by using Layman. If you don't have it already:</p>
<ul><li>emerge layman</li></ul>
<p>You will need to add the following line into /etc/portage/make.conf:</p>
<ul><li>source /var/lib/layman/make.conf</li></ul>
<p>Then use layman to add the overlay:</p>
<ul><li>layman -a steam</li></ul>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>So you'll want to emerge the overlay:</p>
<ul><li>emerge steam-meta -avuDN</li></ul>
<p>Sit back and let it install. Once it is installed you can open the Steam client through the KDE menu. It will take a while to update itself before asking you to log in. Having gone through Steam's new computer confirmation you will be presented with the familiar interface.</p>
<p>Handily when you head to your library you can select Linux Games at the top displaying which games you can install (in my case: TF2, Bastion and Closure are the first few I'm going to test). Install away and enjoy Steam on Linux :D</p>
