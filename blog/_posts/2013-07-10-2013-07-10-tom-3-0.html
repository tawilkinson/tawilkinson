<p><em>In which I start a new fitness/health plan...</em></p>
<p>So I've decided to get fit and lose some weight (again, more on that below). Partly because it is a good idea to do so and also as work towards <a target="_blank" href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55397e91e4b0061c5889b3f0/556839abe4b0d9163c0ffd27/55683ad6e4b0d9163c102fc4/1432894166938/?format=original">Project 0</a> - which I haven't forgotten about, honest!</p>
<h3>Tom 3.0</h3>
<p>Why is this Tom 3.0? I hear you cry. Well Tom 1.0* would be me up to the end of my undergraduate degree. During my first year I weighed 18.5 stone and come graduation with some exercise and healthier eating I had managed to get down to 16.5 stone.</p>
<p>In 2010 I made a concerted effort to improve my health and the results are plain to see:</p>

<p>I have slowly gained weight since then. I was able to motivate myself for a while with <a target="_blank" href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55397e91e4b0061c5889b3f0/556839abe4b0d9163c0ffd27/55683acce4b0d9163c102f72/1432894156641/?format=original">Project Thor</a> but I have let myself creep back up to almost 15 stone (94 kg)!</p>
<p>I need a new plan - Tom 3.0.</p>
<p>*And presumably iterations which I never bothered to determine.</p>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>So the basic plan is to hit exercise and healthy eating hard and maintain it as long as possible. It can take quite  a while to form a habit, the average is 66 days, and I want to get into a regular routine for running.1 The diet (which I'll discuss in more depth next week) is not one I intend to maintain but should help me with the inital loss of weight which always improves my confidence and helps me stick with a plan. It should encourage me to reduce portion sizes and eat healthier though.†</p>
<p>The basic plan:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run daily.‡</li>
<li>Considerable change in diet towards healthier food.</li>
<li>Follow the Tim Ferriss 4-hour Body plan to increase lean muscle mass.2</li>
<li>Maintain this long enough to get into good habits.</li>
</ol>
<p>†A lack of upcoming holidays will probably help too!</p>
<p>‡I accept that I won't always manage to run every day but even if I manage 5 days a week that's a significant improvement over my current lack of exercise.</p>
<h3>Running &amp; The Gym</h3>
<p>Last year I ran the London Marathon, since then I've let things slip considerably.§ I want to get up to running 5 miles daily again as this will be a) healthy and b) good practice for a 10K I'm doing in September.</p>
<p>I won't go into much detail of the 4-hour body plan as I've <a target="_blank" href="https://ttss.squarespace.com/tinker-tailor-soldier-sponge/2012/08/10/project-thor-exercise-plan">mentioned it before</a>.</p>
<p>§In 5 hours 19 minutes :)</p>
<h3>Tom 3.0</h3>
<p>I'm going to be posting weekly updates (probably on Mondays) with my weight and measurements and other data. Then you can all see if this works for me and also I will hopefully stick to it better :)</p>
