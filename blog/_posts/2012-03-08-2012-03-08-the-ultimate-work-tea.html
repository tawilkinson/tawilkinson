<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_468040">A chance sighting in Sainsbury's has allowed me to track down a tea I had previously sought but found impossible to find in the North.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_468043"><strong>Brewing</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_468047"><em>"Brew one teabag per person &amp; pour on boiling water. Leave for three to four minutes, or until you think it's ready. Then drink it as it is, this one is made for drinking without milk.</em></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_468051"><em>"</em></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_468055">Easy to brew and best of all needs no milk! (See previous work tea comments)</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_468058"><strong>Colour</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_468065">Light brown - one could fancifully say it has a golden hue too :).</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_468068"><strong>Aroma</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_468072">
As with Earl Grey you can smell the bergamot and there is also a hint of lemon.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_468077"><strong>Taste</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_468081">
Do you like Earl Grey with lemon? Then this is similar. Obviously you can't control the strength of the lemon as you can when you add your own. However as a work tea it allows me to enjoy Earl Grey without the need for the fridge (I do like Earl Grey with milk and without - there is nothing wrong with this).</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_468086"><strong>"Whistle While You Work"</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_468090">
This tea is definitely the cornerstone of my work teas now where I sometimes whistle. This allows me to make the above tenuous song title usable. Although I have recently learnt how to whistle more than one note which I previously found impossible so maybe I can finally whistle properly while working :)</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_468095"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_468099">
An excellent workplace tea which once again fills my requirement of no milk due to lack of fridge. Though I must concede if you have a ready suppply of lemons your normal Earl Grey will do just fine.</p>
