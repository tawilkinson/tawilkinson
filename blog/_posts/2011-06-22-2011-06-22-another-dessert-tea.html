<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_95464">It appears that Whittards are particularly fond of dessert based tea and so this week we turn to the delightful Loose Leaf Apple Crumble Flavoured Tea!</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_95467"><em>This tea was discovered by Tom B and the tasting sample kindly donated by Rach T.</em></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_95473"><strong>Brewing</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_95477"><strong></strong><em>"Always drink lightly brewed with 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of leaves per 6-cup teapot. Warm the pot first with a splash of hot water. Add the tea and pour on boiling water. Brew for 2-5 minutes. Do not add milk."</em></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_95482">The instructions don't differ much from the other Whittard teas. Again milk is not required and I went for ~5 minutes brewing time (this is a very light tea).</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_95485"><strong>Colour</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_95489"><strong></strong>
Very pale brown.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_95493"><strong>Aroma</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_95497">A lovely light smell of apples with a hint of cinnammon. This might not quite send you to an English orchard as the advertising blurb claims but very enjoyable.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_95511">Â but once again I was surprised! It is very light with hints of apple, cinnamon and vanilla and much more reminiscent of a herbal tea.Personally I'm a fan of strong tea so I feel this is unlikely to become a regular addition to my afternoon. That said, however, it was a refreshing change and definitely worth a try.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_95520">There's no music this week as I had guests around for the tea tasting. Instead our conversation had an old episode of Supermarket Sweep for background featuring Dale Winton's orange face (though not as orange as </p>
