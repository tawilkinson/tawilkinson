<p>As with most of my Tinker posts to do with computers this is a guide to something I might need to do again in the future. You can probably find out how to do it online but I struggled with bits and am putting it here for my own and other's reference.</p>
<p>I am currently demonstrating a C++ lab at the University and it's good to be able to run the example code myself ahead of time. Also I am continuing to teach myself C++ as part of <a target="_blank" href="https://ttss.squarespace.com/tinker-tailor-soldier-sponge/2013/01/17/project-euler">Project Euler</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>QT Creator</h2>
<p>QT Creator is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which features (among other things):</p>
<ul>
<li>C/C++ support</li>
<li>QML support - allows you to make GUIs quickly</li>
<li>Cross platform compiling</li>
<li>App publishing tools</li>
<li>The awesome tag-line "One framework to rule them all"</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find out more at the <a target="_blank" href="http://qt-project.org/">QT Project </a>website.*</p>
<p>*QT is owned by digia who produce a commercial version. I have only linked to the open source implementation.</p>
<h2>Windows</h2>
<p>I am running Windows 8 Pro with Media Centre (64-bit) currently.</p>
<p>So running Windows 8 the QT 5.0.1 open source installer (<a href="http://qt-project.org/downloads">http://qt-project.org/downloads</a>) doesn't run at all.* This version should install everything but for reasons I couldn't fathom it doesn't install.</p>
<p>Assuming you don't own <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us">Microsoft Visual Studio</a> already the free version of QT requires you install <a target="_blank" href="http://mingw.org/">MinGW</a>. MinGW is a minimalist GNU environment on Windows and includes GCC as it's compiler. If you want to use CMake and versioning it is a good idea to install <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://msysgit.github.com/">MSysGit</a>.</p>
<p>Eventually I installed QT 4.8.4 for Windows (32-bit). I then installed QT creator 2.6.2 as a standalone program.</p>
<h3>Configuring</h3>
<p>You need to set quite a few things to get QT up and running if you can't use the full installer.</p>
<p>Firstly you need to set the QT version correctly. Find the directory for your version of QT and set in in Tools&gt;Options&gt;Build &amp; Run&gt;QT Version.</p>
<p>Secondly you need to point QT creator to MinGW. This involves messing around with your Windows environment variables:</p>
<ol>
<li>For Windows 8 go to Control Panel&gt;System&gt;Advanced system settings&gt;Environment Variables.</li>
<li>Click add new.</li>
<li>Set name as MINGWDIR and set the value as C:&lt;path to mingw&gt; (C:mingw if you used the default settings for standalone MinGW).</li>
<li>Click add new.</li>
<li>Set name as PATH and the value as %MINGWDIR%bin.</li>
<li>Accept changes and exit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Secondly add in CMake in the CMake tab by browsing to the executable in Tools&gt;Options&gt;Build &amp; Run&gt;CMake.</p>
<p>Thirdly add versioning by pointing Tool&gt;Options&gt;Version Control&gt;Git to the Git directory in C:&lt;path to msysgit&gt;git.</p>
<p>Finally you need to set your debugger correctly. I used GDB through MinGW but it didn't autodetect correctly. Point Tools&gt;Options&gt;Build &amp; Run&gt;QT Version</p>
<p>After all this I could compile the example code for a QML Hello World program. When I ran it this lead to a segfault. I couldn't be bothered to faff anymore (a search for "segfault QT creator" will return loads of results unrelated to the problem) and switched to Linux. I will have a look into sorting this in the future.</p>
<p>*Well sometimes the Windows Installer process would start but I had to keep killing it in Task manager as it didn't do anything for hours.</p>
<h2>Gentoo Linux</h2>
<p>I am running Gentoo Linux 3.3.8 (64-bit) currently.</p>
<p>Make sure to update Gentoo as good practice first*:</p>
<ol><li>Run as root: emerge --sync &amp;&amp; emerge -avuDN world</li></ol>
<p>Then install:</p>
<ol>
<li>USE="examples git jadtex cmake minizip" emerge qt-creator -avuDN†</li>
<li>Add your git directory - /usr/bin/ in a lot of cases.</li>
<li>Done!</li>
</ol>
<p>*Since udev had a weird update and portage needed updating and I haven't been on Gentoo for over a month this took me a while.</p>
<p>†Your USE flags may differ - listen to Portage, that's what it's for!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Gentoo wins! :)</p>

<p>P.S. I am going to pre-empt the "You should have started using QT years ago" comment from my friend <a target="_blank" href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55801e15e4b00ddc71aed22b/558162dfe4b02f867397ba50/5581645fe4b02f867397e49b/1434543199278/?format=original">Ben</a>.</p>
