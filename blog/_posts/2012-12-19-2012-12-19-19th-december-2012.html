<p><em>In which an old school friend releases a charity single...</em></p>
<p>A friend from school (all the way back in Reception I believe but definitely through Pre-Prep, Prep and Senior school) has released a Christmas song! It's raising money for the children's charity <a target="_blank" href="http://futuresforkids.org.uk/">Futures For Kids</a> and I think it's pretty good too :)</p>

HO! HO! (Way To Go!) by Sam Furness</a></iframe>
 
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_243985">You can download the song for as much money as you care to donate from:<a data-cke-saved-href="http://samfurness.bandcamp.com/" href="http://samfurness.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"> http://samfurness.bandcamp.com/</a> and hopefully there will be more music from Sam in the future.</p>
