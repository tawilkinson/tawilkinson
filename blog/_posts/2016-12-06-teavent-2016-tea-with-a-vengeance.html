<p><em>In which I drink 3 more teas...</em></p>
<p>So despite my plan to drink 2 teas yesterday I accidentally slept away my jetlag. Which means another bumper, 3 tea issue today!</p>

<h1>#4 - Fruity Christmas</h1>
<p><strong>Tea Style:</strong> Fruit infusion.</p>
<p><strong>Flavours: </strong>Apples, honeydewmelon, cinnamon, chicory, raisins, hibiscus.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> This smells really festive but once again only the main flavour was particularly obvious. Even brewing at the upper end (a 5 minute brew) I can't seem to eek out the more interesting flavours. Once again, pleasant but not festive.</p>

<h1>#5 - Gingerbread Tea</h1>
<p><strong>Tea Style: </strong>Rooibos.</p>
<p><strong>Flavours:</strong> Ginger, cinnamon, raisins, cardamom, apples.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> This one smells even more festive than the last tea :) As for flavour both the ginger and cinnamon are pretty strong and the tea has a lovely, spicy warming taste. Festive, tasty and a real winter warmer!</p>

<h1>#6 - Mrs Claus' Cuppa</h1>
<p><strong>Tea Style:</strong> Herbal infusion.</p>
<p><strong>Flavours: </strong>Lemongrass, peppermint, cinnamon, garcinia leaf, lemon peel, hibiscus, strawberries.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict: </strong>I hadn't realised I was such a fan of peppermint teas. This one is very distinct from tea #3 which I attrivute mostly to the lemongrass. Another very nice brew but I wouldn't call it particularly festive.</p>
