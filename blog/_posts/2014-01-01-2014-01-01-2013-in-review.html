<p>The WordPress.com stats helper monkeys prepared a 2013 annual report for this blog.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>The concert hall at the Sydney Opera House holds 2,700 people. This blog was viewed about <strong>8,700</strong> times in 2013. If it were a concert at Sydney Opera House, it would take about 3 sold-out performances for that many people to see it.</p></blockquote>
