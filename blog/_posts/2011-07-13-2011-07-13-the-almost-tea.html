I went for the interestingly named Rooibos tea which until recently I knew nothing about (except that my friend Aisha was a fan of it).</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_70144">For those who don't know Rooibos (or Redbush) tea is made from a bush found in Africa and is naturally caffeine free. Since it is not made from true tea leaves it counts as a herbal tea. It is still full of anti-oxidants though!</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_70147"><strong>Brewing</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_70156"><em>"Use freshly drawn water. Use water at a rolling boil. Steep for 3 to 5 minutes (or to your taste) to release all of the flavour. Delicious with or without milk."</em></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_70160">I brewed this tea for about 4 minutes but I didn't keep diligent track of the time since I was enjoying myself in a restaurant. I enjoyed this herbal tea with milk partly because if you can have milk in tea I normally do and partly because I left the waiter standing there for so long while I made my decision that it would have been rude not to. </p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_70163"><strong>Colour</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_70172">A rich red-brown colour that compares to most everyday teas.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_70175"><strong>Aroma</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_70179">The aroma is nothing special, smelling very much like an ordinary tea.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_70182"><strong>Taste</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_70186">This was the most interesting part as I had absolutely no idea what to expect because herbal teas have such a wide range of flavours. Rooibos tea, it turns out, tastes very similar to normal tea. In fact had I not known it was different I would likely have thought nothing of it and assumed it was simply normal tea. </p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_70189">Since this is clearly marketed as caffeine free alternative and is a lot nicer than many decaf teas I can definitely see the appeal.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_70192"><strong>Cake &amp; Conversation</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_70196">I tried this tea with a slice of carrot cake (Café Rouge is yet another place which does a 'cake &amp; coffee' deal) and a delightful conversation.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_70199"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_70203">Very similar to your standard teas but without the caffeine. A pleasant surprise!</p>
