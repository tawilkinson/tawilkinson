<p><em>In which I look back on a year (ish) of blogging and look ahead to 2013...</em></p>
<h2>That Was The Year That Was!</h2>
<p>Firstly WordPress have provided this nice summary of my year in blogging: <a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55397e91e4b0061c5889b3f0/556839abe4b0d9163c0ffd27/55683ad6e4b0d9163c102fbe/1432894166053/annual-report?format=original">http://tinkertailorsoldiersponge.com/2012/annual-report</a></p>
<p>So this is my first proper year of blogging (I posted a few things before but wasn't really regular at all). It's been a lot of fun and I'm definitely here to stay :) I've managed the majority of my 3,000 odd views this year :)</p>
<p>Let the summarising commence!</p>
<h3>Tinker</h3>
<p>I've messed about with <a href="https://ttss.squarespace.com/tinker-tailor-soldier-sponge/2012/08/14/gentoo-64-bit">Linux</a> and Windows. I <a href="https://ttss.squarespace.com/tinker-tailor-soldier-sponge/2012/12/17/just-over-a-fortnight-of-windows-8">upgraded to Windows 8</a> and enjoyed it (it hasn't pissed me off yet!). I've also spent a fair amount of time learning $latex LaTeX$.</p>
<h3>Tailor</h3>
<p>The main event was <a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55397e91e4b0061c5889b3f0/556839abe4b0d9163c0ffd27/55683acce4b0d9163c102f72/1432894156641/?format=original">Project Thor</a> which was a lot of fun and helped keep me in shape.</p>
<h3>Soldier</h3>
<p>I didn't do much in the way of Airsoft this year :(</p>
<h3>Sponge</h3>
<p>Due to foolishly agreeing to bake a cake for every <a target="_blank" href="http://manchesterstudentsunion.com/groups/choir-orchestra-society-caos">CAOS</a> rehearsal in order to become Social Secretary I have baked a lot of cakes this year. Also there was the <a target="_blank" href="https://ttss.squarespace.com/tinker-tailor-soldier-sponge/2012/11/16/pudding-party">annual Pudding Party</a>!</p>
<h3>PhD</h3>
<p>I've had a placement at AstraZeneca which has been very useful and is still on going. I've also started looking into <a target="_blank" href="https://ttss.squarespace.com/tinker-tailor-soldier-sponge/2012/10/19/postdoc-options">PostDoc options</a>.</p>
<h3>Reviews</h3>
<p>I reviewed a <a target="_blank" href="https://ttss.squarespace.com/tinker-tailor-soldier-sponge/2012/11/07/review-a-game-of-thrones-the-board-game">board game </a>based on a TV show <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_(TV_series)">you might just have heard of</a>. I also made an <a target="_blank" href="https://ttss.squarespace.com/tinker-tailor-soldier-sponge/2012/11/30/advent-2012">advent calendar</a> full of alternative Christmas songs :)</p>
<h3>Tea</h3>
<p>I drank lots of tea and so it was a good year :)</p>
<p>I got featured on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/tea/">http://www.reddit.com/r/tea/</a> which was awesome! This is thanks to the <a target="_blank" href="https://ttss.squarespace.com/tinker-tailor-soldier-sponge/2012/12/13/the-great-british-tea-test-2012">Great British Tea Test 2012</a> :)</p>
<h2>On to 2013!</h2>
<p>Having survived the apocalypse let's have a few New Year's Resolutions:</p>
<h3>Tinker</h3>
<p>I'll keep tinkering. No particular promises here but expect some more $latex LaTeX$ and Linux stuff along with anything interesting I find out :)</p>
<h3>Tailor</h3>
<ul>
<li>There will be some cryptic updates to <a target="_blank" href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55397e91e4b0061c5889b3f0/556839abe4b0d9163c0ffd27/55683ad6e4b0d9163c102fc4/1432894166938/?format=original">Project 0</a> soon!</li>
<li>
<a target="_blank" href="http://ssago.man.ac.uk/">ManSSAGO</a> is hosting the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssagorally.org.uk/news.asp">Manchester 2013 Cartoon Rally</a> in February which I intend to have a costume for (I'm thinking Inspector Gadget).</li>
<li>
<a target="_blank" href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55397e91e4b0061c5889b3f0/556839abe4b0d9163c0ffd27/55683ad7e4b0d9163c102fc7/1432894167189/?format=original">Project Reynolds</a> has a slight delay due to the party being moved back. This Project will be finished by mid-February.</li>
<li>I intend to get down to 13 stone for Project Reynolds and then down to 12½ stone by October.</li>
<li>There will be more sotumes later in the year :)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Soldier</h3>
<ul>
<li>I will definitely airsoft more next year!</li>
<li>There will be some site reviews!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sponge</h3>
<p>I'm 'contractually obliged' to make cakes until March sometime once a week so expect more cake making. It'll give me an excuse to use my new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.masoncash.co.uk/Product/Products/CaneMixingBowls">Mason Cash mixing bowl</a> and silicon utensils :D</p>
<h3>PhD</h3>
<ul>
<li>I'll finish my placement at AZ.</li>
<li>I will get a paper written (and hopefully published).</li>
<li>I will collect all of the data!</li>
<li>I will probably decide on PostDocs/future plans.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reviews</h3>
<p>I'm expecting to get the following things* to review next year:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sjgames.com/ogre/products/ogre6e/">OGRE Designer's edition</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://dftba.com/product/132/Evil-Baby-Orphanage-Card-Game">Evil Baby Orphanage</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ouya.tv/">OUYA</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://stoicstudio.com/forum/the-banner-saga-factions.php">The Banner Saga</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hiddenpath/defense-grid-2">Defense Grid: Containment</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://wasteland.inxile-entertainment.com/">Wasteland 2</a></li>
</ul>
<p>*I should go on KickStarter less!</p>
<h3>Tea</h3>
<p>Armed with my trusty new leaf tea, teapot and a new review style I will continue to drink lots of tea!</p>
<p>Tom Out!</p>
