<p><em>In which I post a really late cake...</em></p>
<p>Apologies for further lack of tea - reviews will be coming next week I promise :)</p>
<h2>MRI Cake</h2>
<p>2 years ago, just as I had started this blog*, I had to go to a departmental barbecue and they asked people to make cakes - this is what I did!</p>
<p>*before I posted regularly.</p>
<h3>The Cake</h3>
<ul>
<li>I used a simple sponge recipe to make two 9" round chocolate cakes.Â </li>
<li>I used a round cookie cutter to remove the centre of one of the cakes.</li>
<li>I stuck the cakes together with jam.</li>
<li>I used ready roll icing to cover the cake pushing it down around the edges.</li>
<li>And trimmed the icing to make a hole and give it nice edges.</li>
<li>I then made a scanner bed out of icing.</li>
<li>And put the correct writing onto the 'scanner'.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Finished Article</h3>
<p>So it was based on one of these:</p>

<p>And ended up looking like this:</p>
