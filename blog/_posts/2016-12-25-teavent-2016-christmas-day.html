<p><em>After 12 days of repeat teas I get to the final tea...</em></p>
<h2>#25 Christmas Day Bonanza</h2>

<p><strong>Tea Style: </strong>Rooibos.</p>
<p><strong>Flavours: </strong>cinnamon, rooibos, hibiscus, ginger, coconut, lychee.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> This one was very disappointing. Depsite the main ingredient being cinnamon it wasn't as spicy or festive as any of the previous teas. All the other flavours were hard to distinguish though the hibiscus did colour the brew. </p>
<p>While this advent calendar was fun to try I would much rather it contained proper black tea. I don't think I would buy it again.</p>
