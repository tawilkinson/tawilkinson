<p><em>And the sun is high, all the birds are singing, this is one to try...</em></p>
<p>So a shiny tea I haven't reviewed yet and some news :)</p>

<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_33_1437603153336_8634">Jasmine Green Tea</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_33_1437603153336_7736">Apologies for the slow tea reviewing - there's been lots of work and holidaying.*</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_33_1437603153336_7737">So this is yet another tea I purchased at the Whittard's outlet shop. I bought a big box with lots of different 5 x tea bags sets in it. And having never had Jasmine tea before I figured I should sample something new.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_33_1437603153336_7738">This tea is lovely. As I've said I've not tasted Jasmine before though I have been aware of what it smells like. The tea mostly tastes of Jasmine which is a change from the majority of my green teas. It's a nice break from the sheer amount of green tea I seem to drink at work now. It breaks up the monotony (as does the <a data-cke-saved-href="https://ttss.squarespace.com/tinker-tailor-soldier-sponge/2013/03/13/green-earl-grey" href="https://ttss.squarespace.com/tinker-tailor-soldier-sponge/2013/03/13/green-earl-grey" target="_blank">Earl Grey</a> one).</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_33_1437603153336_7739">Recommendation: Tasty &amp; different, enjoy!</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_33_1437603153336_7740">*That's totally a verb isn't it?†</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_33_1437603153336_7741">†It actually is in the Oxford Dictionary, I was surprised.</p>
<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_33_1437603153336_7742">Upcoming Things!</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_33_1437603153336_7743">So you may have noticed I've not really been updating  my blog sections on <a data-cke-saved-href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55397e91e4b0061c5889b3f0/556839abe4b0d9163c0ffd27/55683ad8e4b0d9163c102fd0/1432894168218/?format=original" href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55397e91e4b0061c5889b3f0/556839abe4b0d9163c0ffd27/55683ad8e4b0d9163c102fd0/1432894168218/?format=original" target="_blank">MRI</a> and <a data-cke-saved-href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55397e91e4b0061c5889b3f0/556839abe4b0d9163c0ffd27/55683ad8e4b0d9163c102fd3/1432894168417/?format=original" href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55397e91e4b0061c5889b3f0/556839abe4b0d9163c0ffd27/55683ad8e4b0d9163c102fd3/1432894168417/?format=original" target="_blank">PhD</a> related stuff. There are some reasons for this:</p>
<ol id="yui_3_17_2_33_1437603153336_7744">
<li>I've had difficulty finding the time to write the posts.‡</li>
<li>I've had difficulty putting the ideas into written words, I think I need a new medium...</li>
<li>I'm planning on starting a YouTube channel to discuss Science-y things, PhD stuff, being a young researcher and occasionally poking fun at the life of a researcher.</li>
</ol>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_33_1437603153336_7745">So look out for my new YouTube channel coming soon to a screen near you!</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_33_1437603153336_7746">‡This is getting better recently :)</p>
