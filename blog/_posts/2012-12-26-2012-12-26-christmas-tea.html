<p>This is the 100th post of my blog and since my tea reviews have been getting a little samey recently I'm going to change my review style.</p>
<h2>Christmas Tea</h2>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>£7.95 for a metal tea caddy. Less though if you buy it bagged.</p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>When I was camping near Ilkely I was able to visit Betty's Ilkley Tea Room and purchase their Christmas Tea blend.</p>
<p>This tea comes as loose leaves in a lovely tea caddy (pictured, also available in smaller quantities bagged). The tea looks like black tea with mixed peel and spices added in.</p>
<p>It takes 3-5 minutes to brew so as usual I went for the full five minutes. This tea is best drunk without milk.</p>
<p>The tea is lovely. The black tea flavour is there but it is subdued. There are strong overtones of cinammon, clove and orange. It is indeed very Christmassy though I think a cup at a time is probably enough for me. It's gorgeous but not a everyday brew. Very warming in these winter months though :)</p>
