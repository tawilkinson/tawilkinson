<p>The only other white tea I've tried before this was an Earl Grey variant which overpowered the tea a little. So this is my first time properly trying white tea.</p>
<p>It's a delicate tea and so only needs a quick brew of 2-3 minutes. This tea tastes as if it falls between green tea and black tea. It's very enjoyable :)</p>
<p>It's nice to have something to break up my green tea-black tea-green tea rotation I have at work :)</p>
