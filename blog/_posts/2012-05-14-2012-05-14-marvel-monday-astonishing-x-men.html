<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_450386">I was going to start off my new blog incarnation by reviewing the Avengers. However, I figured that has a) been done to death and b) any geek worth their salt should have seen it by now. In short - it is excellent, go and see it. The 3D doesn't detract from but also doesn't improve the film really. Anyway onto this review...</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_450389"><em>"They're Gifted. They're Dangerous. They're Torn. They're Unstoppable"</em><strong> ... and they definitely astonish!</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_450395">Astonishing X-Men is a hardcover omnibus which covers Joss Whedon's full run behind the wheel of the comic. There's 672 full colour pages of awesomeness contained within.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_450398">[A note on SPOILERS: There won't be any as long as you don't consider mentioning the names of X-men a spoiler (they are on the cover after all) or vague allusions to awesomeness]</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_450401"><strong>The Cast</strong><strong></strong></p>
<div class="sqs-image sqs-empty"><div class="sqs-image-content"></div></div>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_450407">The main cast features Wolverine, Cyclops, Emma Frost, Beast, Kitty Pryde &amp; Colossus (see cover &amp; pic above). There's also your usual Marvel background organisations around (S.H.I.E.L.D. etc.) and a new main villain introduced early in the story :)</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_450410">Personally my favourites have to be Wolverine, Kitty and Emma. They have the best humourous lines and scenes in the comic. Emma Frost is still the catty queen of put-downs and well Kitty can phase through walls with sometimes hilarious consequences.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_450414"><strong>The Art</strong>
The artwork is second to none when it comes to quality and equally has a sense of humour with some of the best humourous facial expressions I've seen (see this individual comic cover which cracked me up -&gt;).</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_450419">Also the characters are all reasonably presented - no impossible curves or muscles. I think I prefer the characters like this but that's a personal choice. Although Beast does look more like a cat than usual which is a little odd.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_450422"><strong>The Writing</strong><strong></strong>
If you've seen anything by Joss Whedon you should be expecting excellent writing and he doesn't disappoint! There is humour, darkness and some surprises in store. I laughed out loud several times while reading this series and couldn't put it down :)</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_450428"><strong>The Awesomeness</strong><strong></strong>
Pretty much every page - some of the double page artwork blew me away. As did most of the dialog!</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_450434"><strong>The Conclusion</strong><strong></strong>
If you do read comics - this is definitely a read you will enjoy.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_450440">If you don't read comics - I would definitely suggest this as a way to get into them - it's excellent!</p>
