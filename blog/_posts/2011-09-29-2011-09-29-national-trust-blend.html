<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_501751">This weekend I had the chance to visit Lyme Park just south of Manchester (famous for being where they filmed Mr. Darcy's lake scene [below])
</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_501754"><em>As far as I know you can only try this tea at National Trust sites. You might be able to purchase it in one of their shops but you cannot order it from their website :(</em></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_501760"><strong>Brewing</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_501769">Comes in a metal teapot for one. Brew it as you like but I let it steep for a few minutes.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_501774"><strong>Colour</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_501783">As tea coloured as you could expect tea to be. This is their standard tea offeringÂ after-all.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_501786"><strong>Aroma</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_501792">While Freshers' Flu has taken hold and I couldn't really smell my tea I would expect it smells like your standard tea (assuming your standard tea isn't Earl Grey).</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_501795"><strong>Taste</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_501801">This is a pleasant blend which complemented by Bakewell Tart superbly. While being a general tea blend it was distinct from the Yorkshire Tea we had been drinking on camp (a comparison of day-to-day teas is to come :) ). It is a standard tea though - without a direct comparison to another it just tastes like a nice cup of tea.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_501808"><strong>Adventure is out there!</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_501814">This tea was enjoyed post-adventure playgrounding (I think I just invented a word) and was well deserved by all :) I think there may have been discussion of Oil for some reason (blame to Matt and Dale).</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_501820"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_501826">An enjoyable, very normal cup of tea. The perfect representation of British tea to have at the National Trust.</p>
