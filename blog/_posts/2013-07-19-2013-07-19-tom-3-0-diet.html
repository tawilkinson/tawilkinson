<p><em>In which I run down the basics of the diet I'm currently following...</em></p>
<p>So I'm happy to report I'm already down 4 kilos from the start of Tom 3.0 :D Let's get onto discussing the diet!</p>
<h3>Basic Concept</h3>
<p>So I've based the basic concept on information found at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/6-pack-abs-diet-strategy-that-gets-results.htm">Bodybuilding.com</a> &amp;  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.menshealth.com/weight-loss/weight-loss-abs-diet-and-six-pack-abs?fullpage=true">Mens Health</a>.* My idea was to follow a strict six pack diet plan for around a month as though it is unlikely to give me a six pack it should help with weight loss. Also it is clearly working currently :)</p>
<p>*The second one is definitely worth a read even if it is just for the terrible attempt to shoe-horn the power foods suggested into the acronym ABS DIET POWER.</p>
<h3>Calorie Intake</h3>
<p>At the start I was on 94 kg (207 lbs) and at 9-13 calories a day that means I should be eating between 1,861 - 2,688 kcal a day. I think I'm already near the higher end naturally and on most work days hang around 2,000 though I do end up feeling hungry. Luckily increasing protein will put paid to any hunger pangs.</p>
<h3>Protein Intake</h3>
<p>The calculator states I should be eating between 248 - 310 grams of protein per day. Since the upper limit is around 10 whole chicken breasts I doubt I will actually be aiming for that higher end.† Eating a lot of protein though will help me stop feeling too hungry. I'm also going to be taking protein shakes following any gym workouts.</p>
<p>†Except maybe on big workout days.</p>
<h3>Power Breakfast</h3>
<p>Adapted from: <a href="http://www.menshealth.com/weight-loss/weight-loss-abs-diet-and-six-pack-abs?fullpage=true">http://www.menshealth.com/weight-loss/weight-loss-abs-diet-and-six-pack-abs?fullpage=true</a></p>

<h3>'Reeses Pieces' Protein Shake</h3>
