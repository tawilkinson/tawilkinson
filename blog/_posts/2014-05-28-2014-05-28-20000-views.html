<p><em>In which I discuss some blog stats...</em></p>
<p>Firstly thank you everyone who has come to my little corner of the internet to get me to this point. When I started off a little blog about tea 3 years ago I never expected it to be seen by anyone outside my group of friends. Secondly I actually ticked over 20,000 views about a week back but haven't had the time to write this post until now.</p>
<h3>Best Day for the Blog</h3>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_19_1437603153336_7579">The best day for my blog is still 24/12/12 when on Christmas Eve a friend of mine shared <a target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://ttss.squarespace.com/tinker-tailor-soldier-sponge/2012/12/13/the-great-british-tea-test-2012" href="https://ttss.squarespace.com/tinker-tailor-soldier-sponge/2012/12/13/the-great-british-tea-test-2012" id="yui_3_17_2_19_1437603153336_7948">The Great British Teat Test 2012</a> with the <a target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="http://reddit.com/r/tea" href="http://reddit.com/r/tea">Tea subreddit</a>. I garnered a total of 488 views from 419 people that day which must've boosted my search engine ranking. I started receiving a steady stream of visitors after that. I am planning on doing another, this time comparing types of Earl Grey later in the year.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_19_1437603153336_6734">Apparently the internet loves guides on dealing with Microsoft, computer related stuff tea and cake. And that's fine by me! I enjoy those topics and will continue to post about them.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_19_1437603153336_5694">Excluding yearly tags I think it's very clear that computer related posts are my winners with PhD related posts also do well. As my PhD winds down there will probably be a few more posts about it before a final review in September/October. Computer related posts will likely be on the rise as I'm looking for programming jobs currently.</p>
<h3>Changes Ahead?</h3>
<p>I'm going to try and post more frequently and make more computer related posts but I doubt I'm going to get much posted until my thesis is finished.</p>
<p>I also want to revive my <a target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="http://youtube.com/use/wyl2km" href="http://youtube.com/use/wyl2km">YouTube channel</a>Â - I have some video ideas but currently no time to get them made. Hopefully I'll get some time over summer to work on on or two.</p>
