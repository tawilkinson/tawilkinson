<p><em>In which I talk about fitness and the road ahead...</em></p>
<h3>Tom 3.5</h3>
<p>So once again I am unhappy with my level of physical fitness having let it slide a lot with work and other stress getting in the way. I need a new ridiculous goal but first I need to get back to my old fitness levels. I'm back on the old horse having started running everyday again and I've rejoined the gym. Expect a longer post in about 2 weeks time about how things are going.</p>
<p>I'm thinking my next "ridiculous challenge" should either be <a target="_blank" href="https://toughmudder.co.uk/">Tough Mudder</a> or an ultra marathon (~40 miles not one of the 100 mile ones).</p>
<p>Why Tom 3.5? Well my last fitness drive was <a target="_blank" href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55397e91e4b0061c5889b3f0/556839abe4b0d9163c0ffd27/55683ad9e4b0d9163c102fe6/1432894169994/tailor?format=original">Tom 3.0</a>. This isn't entirely a new leaf it's just me reminding myself to get back to what I was doing and hopefully take it further.</p>

<h3>Procrastination</h3>
<p>So I'm in full thesis writing mode at the moment but that doesn't mean I'm constantly writing. I do procrastinate (though usually with other jobs I need to get done) and this brilliant article explains why that's helpful: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-06/17/jorge-cham-phd">http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-06/17/jorge-cham-phd</a></p>
