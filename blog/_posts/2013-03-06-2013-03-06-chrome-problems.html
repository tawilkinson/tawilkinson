<p><em>In which <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a> causes some problems for once...</em></p>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bUPg1JeiyVw/UTd04uepEeI/AAAAAAAAAF0/669d5DkcJgI/s512/chrome-icon.jpg" title="" alt=""><p id="yui_3_17_2_29_1439841392162_3512">So my work computer has been playing up a lot recently. It's been so slow that I've even had to hard reset several times. I've tried the usual tips and tricks:</p>
<ul id="yui_3_17_2_29_1439841392162_3513">
<li>turning off unnecessary services</li>
<li>turning off unnecessary startup programs</li>
<li>uninstalling unecessary programs</li>
</ul>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_29_1439841392162_3514">None of this worked. Starting up Task Manager I found that Chrome was using about 60% of my CPU even when I wasn't actively using it. This was odd so I had a quick Google...</p>
<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_29_1439841392162_3515">Plugin Problems</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_29_1439841392162_3516">Chrome runs plugins as separate processes (which is why there are so many processes in Task Manager called chrome.exe). If one of these has a high CPU usage you can end the process and chrome will give you an error that the plugin has crashed. You can then disable that plugin.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_29_1439841392162_3517">Annoyingly it was Adobe Flash Player causing the problems. Since I use this all the time I couldn't just uninstall it. The problem was luckily easy to solve - I had enabled hardware acceleration to fix a YouTube bug a few weeks back. Turning that off sped the computer up significantly.</p>
<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_29_1439841392162_3518">Chrome's Malware Feature</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_29_1439841392162_3519">Sorting out <a target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer" href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer">Flash</a> did reduce the load Chrome was putting on the CPU but didn't remove all of it. It turns out that Chrome has a real time anti-malware protection feature which can use a lot of processing power. You can disable it in Settings&gt;Privacy&gt;Enable phishing and malware protection. This didn't have as much of an effect as the Flash problem but has helped speed up my computer. *</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_29_1439841392162_3520">*If you're worried about not having the protection I've found Lavasoft Adaware to be more than ample against malware.</p>
