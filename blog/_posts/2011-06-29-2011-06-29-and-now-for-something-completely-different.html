Having disproved the old adage that hot tea makes you cooler in the summer (this has never, ever worked for me or anyone I've asked under the age of 40. Lies I tell you!) and with this being tennis season I felt some iced tea was in order.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_87144"><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_87153">
<li>8 Tea bags (I have a penchant for Earl Grey)</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Lemon</li>
<li>Sugar (I used brown but caster is fine)</li>
<li>Ice cubes</li>
</ul>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_87172"><strong>Brewing</strong></p>
<ol id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_87181">
<li>Boil 4 cups of fresh, cold water in a saucepan.</li>
<li>Add the tea bags and leave to brew, while covered, for 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove tea bags.</li>
<li>Pour tea into large jug.</li>
<li>Add 4 cups cold water to jug.</li>
<li>Add sugar and lemon to taste.</li>
<li>Add ice cubes to cool the tea to desired temperature.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_87199"><strong>Colour</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_87208">Your iced tea will be a darker brown than commercial brands.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_87211"><strong>Aroma</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_87215">As the tea is cold there is less aroma than usual but you can still pick out the bergamot as well as the lemon. It definitely has a nicer smell than shop bought ice tea.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_87218"><strong>Taste</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_87222">Though I would normally consider sugar in Earl Grey to be sacrilege (though I do add milk which is seen as equally bad by some) it works very well in iced tea. The normally strong flavour of the tea is subdued but still present. All-in-all a pleasant experience.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_87225"><strong>Interesting Facts</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_87229">Iced tea makes up for 85% of all tea consumed in the United States. </p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_87232">There is a very nice story about the recipe being invented at the 1904 St. Louis World Fair but sadly recipes have been found dating back to the 1870s.</p>
