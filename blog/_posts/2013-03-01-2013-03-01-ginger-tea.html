<p id="yui_3_17_2_22_1447584774165_3685">While at a conference (a little while ago) I had the opportunity to visit Cambridge's lovely market. There I purchased a ginger flavoured black tea to try.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_22_1447584774165_3480">This is a lovely cup of tea with or without milk. There is a hint of ginger in the aroma but you can definitely taste it. I love ginger and this is a very pleasant tea experience. With milk in the tea it would be the perfect accompaniment to dessert. Perhaps some gingerbread :) Without milk the black tea flavour is stronger and I might even consider having it as a regular tea.</p>
<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_22_1447584774165_3686">Conclusion</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_22_1447584774165_3687">Lovely gingery black tea. Perfect with milk!</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_22_1447584774165_3689">P.S. Once I find a link for the tea seller I'll update this post with it.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_22_1447584774165_3690">P.P.S. I hope people are enjoying the slightly different review style :)</p>
