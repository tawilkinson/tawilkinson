<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436532691650_60941">Teat for the Tea God! Mugs for the Mug Throne!</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436532691650_60944">I was down to my last few tea bags at work and so decided to head the the Lowry Outlet Mall where there is a Whittard's outlet shop with a few friends.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436532691650_60947">There were some good discounts available:</p>
<ul id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436532691650_60950">
<li>Buy one get one half price on all tea/coffee</li>
<li>Ridiculous discounts on all Christmas packaged products (up to 80% off)</li>
</ul>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436532691650_60956">And now I have a large stock of new tea for work and for reviewing!</p>

<h3>Green Earl Grey</h3>
<p><em>"Stop what you are doing and savour!"</em></p>

With the aforementioned offers I just had to risk it and get hold of some green Earl Grey. This tea is essentially just green tea with bergamot added.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_27_1439841392162_4402">It's a lovely brew and means I can enjoy Earl Grey at work without the need for milk or lemon*. It's lighter than the black tea equivalent and very refreshing. I would heartily recommend it!</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_27_1439841392162_4403">*Yes I drink Earl Grey with milk - I like it that way!</p>
