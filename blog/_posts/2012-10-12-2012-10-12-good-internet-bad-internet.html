<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_242758">Slow Internet</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_242761">Today at work I was using a terribly slow internet connection. What interested me was which programs and websites worked on a slow connection and which ones didn't.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_242764">These programs/sites worked well:</p>
<ul id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_242767">
<li>Wikipedia</li>
<li>Xkcd</li>
<li>Xkcd what if?</li>
<li><a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55397e91e4b0061c5889b3f0/556839abe4b0d9163c0ffd27/556839dce4b0d9163c1007a4/1414664945000/www.evernote.com.com?format=original" target="_blank">Evernote</a></li>
</ul>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_242778">These didn't:</p>
<ul id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_242781">
<li><a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55397e91e4b0061c5889b3f0/556839abe4b0d9163c0ffd27/556839dce4b0d9163c1007a7/1414664949000/www.outlookindia.com.com?format=original" target="_blank">Outlook</a></li>
<li>Outlook web</li>
<li>Wunderlist</li>
<li>Ctrl-Alt-Delete</li>
</ul>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_242792">Google Mail &amp; Calendar were intermittent.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_242795">Why should this be? I'm not sure and would have hazarded a guess that sites and programs which send less data would work better. However, Wunderlist only needs to send short strings of text (calendar events) when Evernote was syncing complete documents. Also with the websites both CAD and Xkcd require images to load. Xkcd managed it easily but I haven't seen today's CAD yet. Maybe the ones which loaded were just better coded/written!?!</p>
<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_242798">Good Wi-Fi</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_242801">Currently I'm writing this from the comfort of First Class with a complimentary glass of Merlot :-) The free Wi-Fi is excellent and speedy - the upgrade was definitely worth it (£2 to upgrade which gets me the normally £6 Wi-Fi, free wine and dinner). My new <a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55397e91e4b0061c5889b3f0/556839abe4b0d9163c0ffd27/556839dce4b0d9163c1007ad/1414664949000/www.archos.com.com?format=original" target="_blank">Archos G9</a> 101 tablet is working very well and for a quick trip like this it's so much better than a laptop.*</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_242810">So my first post written entirely on a tablet has gone well, also having a 250Gb HDD means I've done so to excellent musical accompaniment (<a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55397e91e4b0061c5889b3f0/556839abe4b0d9163c0ffd27/556839dde4b0d9163c1007d8/1414664954000/The_Lord_of_the_Rings?format=original" target="_blank">LotR</a> and <a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55397e91e4b0061c5889b3f0/556839abe4b0d9163c0ffd27/556839dde4b0d9163c1007db/1414664954000/They_Might_Be_Giants?format=original" target="_blank">TMBG</a> among others).</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_242819">*Although I did need to re-calibrate the screen after a recent update.</p>
