<p><em>In which I describe a tea failure of epic proportions...</em></p>
<p>Dear Reader,</p>
<p>Let me set the scene for you. It was a warm but not unpleasant summer afternoon. The kind which threatens rain.* The kind we British deem perfect barbecue whether. And indeed I did barbecue for it was the last evening of Cubs this term.</p>
<p>An enjoyable game of kwik cricket, two burgers and a few glasses of fiery ginger beer later I was satiated. The cubs all left with their respective guardians and I set off home.</p>
<p>On the drive back I got to thinking, as I often do, that I desired some good company and a pot of tea. Potentially even a biscuit to round off the evening.</p>
<p>*Indeed the rain did not fall though it did get gloomier.</p>
<h3>The Return</h3>
<p>The corridor was dark when I returned which did not bode well but my spirits were lifted by the sound of music from a friend's room. I knocked and they sadly stated they were indisposed even where tea was concerned. I thought to myself: "No matter, I'll just have a single cup. No need to break out the leaf tea then. A cup of Yorkshire Tea will do me just fine." Still looking forward to a lovely cuppa I proceeded to the kitchen...</p>
<p>I found the hilariously dishwashed tea bag holder empty.</p>

<p>Upon searching the cupboards I came to the sad conclusion that we must have indeed finished not only the Yorkshire Tea but also the Twinings Everyday. A most distressing set of circumstances but luckily my tea cupboard is vast and plentiful. I turned to it in my hour of need and found a single bag of <a target="_blank" href="http://aspretto.sodexo.com/aspretto/numi-organic/great-tea.asp">Aspretto</a> Breakfast Blend I had picked up at a conference with the intention of reviewing.</p>

<p>I put the kettle on to boil and thought that everything was once again returning to balance. My tea would be ready soon, order would be restored.</p>
<h3>The Horror</h3>
<p>A minute or so passed and the freshly boiled water was deposited carefully over the tea bag. While it brewed I amused myself with emptying the dishwasher. About 3 minutes later with a job well done I was in dire need of a cup of congratulatory tea. I removed the tea bag and detouring only slightly to the bin came by way of the fridge to be holding milk in my hands. A large 4-pint jug my housemates had told me to use as "there was no way they could possibly finish it". As with any milk from the other fridge† I did the cursory glance to check it was not curdled: "All white? Excellent! Tea time it is then!" and began to pour.</p>
<p>The milk came slowly, at first, then in increasingly larger lumps it flopped into my cup. I watched in abject horror as the milk I thought was pure and tasty did, in fact, have the consistency of cottage cheese. The catastrophic curds convulsed and congealed in my cup and dashed any hopes I had of a rejuvenating cuppa :(</p>
<p>In summary, dear reader, this was what I had hoped for:</p>

<p>I received something more like this:</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_29_1437603153336_12687">It is with great regret that I must tell you that I was so upset and appalled by these proceedings that I immediately retired to my room for there was no milk with which to make another cup of tea. Thus my evening must end incomplete and devoid of tea.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>Thomas the Tea-taster</p>
<p>†The other fridge is, I'm pretty certain, less effective than the one I store my food in.</p>
