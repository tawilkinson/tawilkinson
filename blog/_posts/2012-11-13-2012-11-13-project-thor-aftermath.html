<p><em>In which I assess the results of Project Thor using graphs...</em></p>
<h3>Weight Loss</h3>
<p>So the weight loss wasn't as much as I expected but I did gain a fair amount of muscle. I'm pretty certain I look like I've lost some weight which is probably due to the shift of some fat to muscle :)</p>

<h3>Muscle Gain</h3>
<p>I gained a few inches on all of the muscles I measured while also reducing my waist and hip measurements. Again I expected greater gains but I think there was a visible difference by the time I donned my armour :)</p>

<h3>Strength</h3>
<p>The most noticeable change during Project Thor were my strength gains at the gym:</p>
