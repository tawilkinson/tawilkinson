<p><em>In which I present Christmas Wrapping...</em></p>
<p>The elfs* here at Tinker Tailor Soldier Sponge have suggested this song today. It's not the rarest (as it definitely features on at least one version of The Best Christmas Album In The World ... Ever!) , however, it isn't as popular as say A Fairytale of New York is. I really like this song as it tells a story and is pretty festive :)</p>
