<p><em>In which stir-up Sunday comes early and on the wrong day of the week...</em></p>
<p>Although I realise <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stir-up_Sunday">stir-up Sunday</a> is later than this week (and that I made these on a Monday night), it is always good to make your puddings early so that you can top them up with lots of of brandy (feeding the pudding.) Also I always used to make Christmas puddings on Remembrance Day with my school choir.</p>
<p>My mum has always made the best Christmas pudding (as far as i'm concerned) and here is the recipe. This recipe is designed for a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_cooker">Slow cooker</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Obtain mincemeat and pastry.</li>
<li>Place pastry in dish.</li>
<li>Fill with mincemeat.</li>
<li>Bake.</li>
</ol>
<p>UPDATE: Mincemeat tarts came out like this :)</p>
