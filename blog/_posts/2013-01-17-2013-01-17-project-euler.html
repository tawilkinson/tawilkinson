<p><em>In which I get back into coding in C...</em></p>
<p>I did a programming course* during my undergrad but it's fallen by the wayside recently. In an effort to improve my coding skills, and my understanding of maths, I have started on Project Euler.</p>
<p>*I took two actually but only had time for the coursework in one - I might upload my program for it later.</p>
<h3>Project Euler</h3>
<p>Project Euler (<a target="_blank" href="http://projecteuler.net/">http://projecteuler.net/</a>) is a website which sets maths problems and asks you to solve them with programming. There are currently 410 problems for you to solve.</p>
<p>They usually give an example or two and then ask for a harder calculation. Par example, the 6th prime number is 13 - now find the 15,000th.</p>
<p>This has been very helpful for re-learning my coding skills. You have to break down the maths problem into steps and then work out how the hell you would code that. Also it's fun and challenging!</p>
<h3>Timing</h3>
<p>Project Euler says every problem on the site is solvable in about 1 minute. In order to keep track of how good my programs are I've been using a simple timing system that works on Linux. You will need to call <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stdio.h">stdio.h</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time.h">time.h</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unistd.h">unistd.h</a>:</p>
<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true" class="language-c">int main()
{
int p = (int) getpid();
clock_t cstart = clock();
clock_t cend = 0;

// Rest of Program

cend = clock();
printf("%.3f cpu secn", ((double)cend - (double)cstart)* 1.0e-6);
return 0;
}</code></pre>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_32_1447584774165_4861">"Rob say Code Monkey very diligent, But his output stink, His code not 'functional' or 'elegant', What do Code Monkey think?"</p>
<p>My code definitely isn't elegant but it is working. I'm definitely using a brute force approach at the moment. I've just rushed through 3 problems in a row with very little need for an understanding of more than basic maths. A few nested loops and I was away. Sadly I'm now on the aforementioned prime number program and it is taking aaages to run.</p>
<p>This however is the cool thing about Project Euler - in order to solve these problems my programming knowledge† isn't enough. I need to research the maths behind it. As a Physicist I see maths as a tool normally - now I can start to appreciate the elegance of it, which is cool :)</p>
<p>And once I've learnt about the maths behind the problem I need to change my code. This makes me learn new coding techniques and improve my programming skill - win, win!</p>
<p>†and, err, lack of skill.</p>

<p>P.S. My Prime number program started running before I started this post and is still going - I think I need to re-write it :/</p>
