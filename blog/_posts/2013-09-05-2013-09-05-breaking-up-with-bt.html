<p id="yui_3_17_2_21_1437603153336_8426">Dear BT,</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_21_1437603153336_8420">It appears you didn't take the sentiments of my <a target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://ttss.squarespace.com/tinker-tailor-soldier-sponge/2013/08/30/dear-b-t" href="https://ttss.squarespace.com/tinker-tailor-soldier-sponge/2013/08/30/dear-b-t" id="yui_3_17_2_21_1437603153336_8428">previous letter</a> to heart. I'm afraid that is going to be detrimental to our ongoing relationship. In fact I'm afraid I have some bad news for you - we're going to have to part ways.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_21_1437603153336_8422">I'd like to say: "It's not you, it's me". But that's not just true - it is you. It's the constant lying. It's the fact that you barely even call. And when you do it's only to spin more lies. You've not even visited since mid-August!</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_21_1437603153336_8424">I'm afraid I need someone who is more in touch with my needs...and also has HD TV! I'm afraid I'm getting into bed with Sky. I think I explained most of my reasoning last time round but there have been further problems...</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_21_1437603153336_5380">I rang you after last time because I wanted to check that you hadn't managed to get my order wrong again. Or lied to me, <em>again</em>. Turns out there was no order placed or you screwed up in some other incompetent way - You said I'd definitely have a confirmation phone call by Tuesday. This never came. I gave you until lunchtime on Wednesday just in case - You didn't ring.</p>
<p>So I decided to take matters into my own hands and ring your cancellation line. Surprisingly when I threatened to leave you there was pleading and you put me through to someone who "could get this sorted". I explained to them that if I didn't have internet by the end of Friday I would be cancelling my order. They <em>promised</em> that I would have a phonecall within 24 hours and that an engineer visit would be booked for Friday before 5 pm.</p>
<p>Today you managed to ring exactly 24 hours later. Which is, I must admit, both pretty impressive while cutting it fine. You could not deliver, <em><strong>yet</strong><strong> again</strong></em>, on your promises. When I rang through to the cancellation line again I couldn't help but get the impression that the lady on the line heard this <em><strong>all the</strong><strong>time</strong></em>. I have cancelled my internet order - the only good thing about all this is as you haven't installed my connection so you can't charge me a penny for the internet. If you try to charge any cancellation charges rest assured I will be fighting you tooth and nail until you drop them.</p>
<p>I don't want to swear on my blog but I feel, BT, that Shakespeare can help me get some of the anger off of my chest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thou gleeking weather-bitten measle!</li>
<li>There's no room for faith, truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine. It is all filled up with guts and midriff.</li>
<li>You starvelling, you eel-skin, you dried neat's-tongue, you bull's-pizzle, you stock-fish! O for breath to utter what is like thee!-you tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bow-case, you vile standing tuck!</li>
<li>Thou surly whoreson haggard!</li>
<li>Thou art only mark'd for hot vengeance and the rod of heaven!</li>
</ul>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436532691650_271571">I ordered Sky through <a href="http://www.topcashback.co.uk/ref/tomw2005" target="_blank">TopCashBack.com* </a> which means I will be getting £130 back from them in addition to a £100 M&amp;S voucher from Sky. See they've even given me money to compensate me for how useless you were!</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436532691650_271577">Also now I'm going to be able to record and pause live TV :D</p>
