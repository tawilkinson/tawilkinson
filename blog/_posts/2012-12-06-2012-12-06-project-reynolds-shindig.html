<p><em>In which I lay out plans for my next <a target="_blank" href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55397e91e4b0061c5889b3f0/556839abe4b0d9163c0ffd27/55683acce4b0d9163c102f6f/1432894156379/?format=original">Tailor</a> Project...</em></p>
<p>My housemate has decided that his birthday party this year will be Sci-Fi themed so obviously I need to step up to the plate. Time to plan for this shindig!</p>
<h3>The Character</h3>
<p>If you haven't seen <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_%28TV_series%29">Firefly</a>, in short - you should! This awesome series is best described as a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Western">Space Western</a> and is written by the inimitable <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon">Joss Whedon</a>. It follows the adventures of the crew of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379786/">Serenity</a> as they wheel and deal their way through space.*</p>
<p>The captain of this fine ship is Malcolm ‘Mal’ Reynolds who has been described as a cross between Han Solo and Indiana Jones.†</p>
<p>*Sadly it was cancelled during its first season because <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fox.com/">Fox</a> are idiots. They then made a film to finish off the story when the fans demanded it back.</p>
<p>†A quick Google search for Mal Reynolds and Han Solo results in some of the geekiest debates this side of would the Enterprise defeat a Star Destroyer?</p>
<p><strong>The Plan</strong></p>
<ul><li>End up looking something like this:</li></ul>

<p>That should keep me busy over Christmas and the New Year :)</p>
<p>Tom Out!</p>
<p>P.S. Some of the progress towards this will count for Project 0 too. Keep your eye on it, I haven’t forgotten!</p>
