<p><em>In which I bake brownies and try to imitate the inimitable Wade...</em></p>
<p>On Sunday I tasted a brownie and it was good. I asked Wade for the recipe. For those who have never enjoyed a Wade email (he was ManSSAGO secretary) I will try to write this in a similar way to this wonderful worldly wordy wordsmith!</p>
<h3>Culinary Necessities (some optional)*</h3>
<ul>
<li>250g dark chocolate</li>
<li>200g butter</li>
<li>150g brown sugar</li>
<li>350g caster sugar</li>
<li>2 tbsp golden syrup</li>
<li>4 eggs</li>
<li>1-2 tsp vanilla essence (optional)</li>
<li>200g self raising flour</li>
<li>an arbitrary amount of cocoa (1-2 tbsp)</li>
</ul>
<p>*The chef points out that this recipe scales linearly if you want more or less of it</p>
<h3>Mostly Non-arbitrary Techniques to Employ in Some Form of List-like Order</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Apply heat in a manner which causes gentle merging of constituent parts (Melt)</li>
<li>Enjoy in an olfactory manner</li>
<li>Agitate (whisk) the ovoid ovums (eggs)</li>
<li>Mix in the chocolate ecstasy (allow to cool first, you don't want to cook the eggs)</li>
<li>Sieve in ground wheat (flour) and the seed of Theobroma cacao (cocoa)</li>
<li>Fold it in</li>
<li>Apply grease resistant flat tree matter (greaseproof paper) to a containment device (It's a TRAY!)</li>
<li>Chuck in the oven at an arbitrary place on the Celsius scale (~200°C)</li>
<li>Allow the passage of multiple time units (30-40 mins) until stodgy (knife not entirely clean when stabbed through)</li>
<li>Let it return to near room temp</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Enjoy with your sense of gustatory perception</li></ul>
<h3>Remember, Remember</h3>
<p>On the subject of verbose verbiage we're only a day late for one of the best speeches ever:</p>
<p>"Voilà! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villian by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a by-gone vexation, stands vivified and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition. The only verdict is vengence; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it is my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V."</p>
