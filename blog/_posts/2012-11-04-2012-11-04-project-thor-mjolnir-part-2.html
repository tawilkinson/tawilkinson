<p><em>In which I finish Mjolnir...except for the painting.</em></p>
<p>So I was able to get hold of a hot wire cutter but the wire broke and so I have been forced to continue with the pepakura version of Mjolnir.</p>
<h3>The Handle</h3>
<p>First I began by cutting some brown shoelace to the correct length and gluing it to the wooden handle in a loop.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_145583">Then I cut strips of leather the correct length so that they would go all the way around the handle. I glued them around but had to hold them for a long time to let them dry, there must be an easier way to do this!</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_145592">For the hammer head I continued using the pepakura method though I had to cut a hole for the handle to pass through.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_145601">Then i glues the top of the handle to the inside of Mjolnir for stability.</p>

<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_145607">Painting</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_145610">Before painting I first rubberised it with Plastidip which takes a few hours to dry. I then painted the hammer with a dark mix of silver and black acrylic paint. Once this had dried I drybrushed* over the top with silver acrylic paint. I also painted the gaps in the handle with the black base coat and silver over the top.</p>
