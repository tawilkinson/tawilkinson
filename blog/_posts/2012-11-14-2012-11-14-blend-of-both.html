<p><em>In which I try a tea donated by Katy and put Sainsbury's to the test!</em></p>
<p>This tea was donated to me for the express purpose of reviewing on my blog so here it is :)</p>
<h3><strong>Brewing</strong></h3>
<p><em>"It has been expertly created to deliver the delicious full-flavoured taste of original Tetley, but with the natural refreshing benefits of green tea. So you can have it with milk and still enjoy green tea goodness."</em></p>
<p>There are no brewing instructions so I assumed standard Tetley brewing of a minute or two and then added milk.</p>
<h3><strong>Colour</strong></h3>
<p>Tea coloured though it came out a slightly darker hue than the normal blend does.</p>
<h3><strong>Aroma</strong></h3>
<p>Realistically it just smells like tea.</p>
<h3><strong>Taste</strong></h3>
<p>This is a very refreshing blend. Usually I find Tetley very strong but the addition of green tea lightens the blend while still tasting like the standard blend. I'd say it tastes like Tetley light and there is a bit of a green tea aftertaste.</p>
<h3>Data Entry</h3>
<p>This week I 'ave mostly been typing on a computer. Manual data entry is annoying, if only my handwriting wasn't so terrible and I could use <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">OCR</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Web-link</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Like Tetley, but lighter!</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_86537"><em>This week it is time for Sainsbury's Christmas offering.</em></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_86541">Price: £2.70 (although it is in the £3 meal deal too)</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_86544">Taste: A bit different from last time this is turkey, bacon, stuffing, cranberry sauce and salad. The stuffing is lovely and moist and there's no overpowering mayonnaise flavour. The cranberry sauce adds a pleasant aftertaste but is a little subdued. I think the weird thing about this sandwich is that it doesn't seem particularly Christmassy just a glorified chicken and bacon sandwich really. It's still better tasting than the Tesco one but it is still disappointing.</p>
