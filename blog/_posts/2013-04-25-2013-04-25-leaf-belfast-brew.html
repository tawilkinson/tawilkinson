<p>In Leamington Spa meeting up with old friends I found myself in possession of a hangover and thus the need for a recovery breakfast. The Leaf tea rooms and piano bar were suggested as the place to go and go we did. It was a lovely experience - I think we walked in to Paparazzi by Lady Gaga being played on the piano. The tea room has a nice relaxed atmosphere and the soothing piano playing is the perfect backdrop when you have a bit of a headache. Although I wasn't there at tea time I am informed that not only do they do a very filling afternoon tea that they also have a wide selection of delectable cakes.</p>

I was completely stuffed after the meal - it hit the spot perfectly!</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436532691650_433689">*Well the toast could have come pre-buttered, a familial gripe that I explained to my comrades in brunch.</p>

It was richer and stronger than your normal English Breakfast blend. An altogether pleasant experience!</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436532691650_433704">So my plan for this section of the site is for it to become my weekly (ish) blog with attached tea reviews. It'll probably be a little like today's post and I hope everyone enjoys it. It should mix things up a bit as I feel my tea reviews are becoming a little dry.</p>
