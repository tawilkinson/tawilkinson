<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_370107">Firstly an announcment! Tea reviews will re-commence on Wednesday and run bi-weekly for the foreseeable future! Also if there's a tea you think I should try feel free to proffer it to me when I see you for my delectation and reviewing pleasure :)</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_370110">So onto the post -</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_370113">Measurement and tracking is very important when following an exercise program, mostly because it stops you from going insane. This is because it is very hard to see if you are losing weight* if you look in the mirror everyday whereas cold hard numbers don't lie to you**.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_370116">So below is my table of starting measurements before Project Thor so I can compare the results at the end.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_370119">Though in defiance of my earlier paragraph there is a number which lies to you - the waist measurement on your clothes. I've been defiantly wearing my 34" jeans since I managed to be too small for 38" and 36" jeans last year. Recently they have gotten tighter but still fit (sadly all the cake I've eaten this year was not a lie). Now hopefully you haven't scrolled down far enough to see the measurement table yet - do so now and see how inaccurate this flattering lie is!</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_370148">89</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_370151">40.5</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_370154">39.5</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_370157">12</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_370160">12</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_370166">22.5</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_370169">148</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_370172">Even if you ignore the half inch which would explain the slight tightness of my trousers that's still wrong by 6 inches! A 17% inaccuracy. Maybe if they gave clothing sizes accurately across the board it would help solve our obesity problem.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_370175">Finally, the total inches measurement allows you to see if there is an overall improvement even if, par exemple, your waist doesn't decrease one week. Huzzah for improvements!</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_370178">*Well weight is affected by muscle mass and fat so it is possible to stay the same weight while looking more trim, but generally.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_370181">**The scientist inside me forces me to point out I mean mass which is referred to as weight; obviously going to the moon is great for any weight-loss program :P</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_370184">Tom out!</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_370187">P.S. This P.S. is a lie!</p>
