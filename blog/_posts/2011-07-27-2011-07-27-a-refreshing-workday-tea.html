<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_52974">On a recent trip to replace my green tea at work I decided to be daring and try a tea company I was not familiar with - Clipper.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_53012"><strong>Brewing</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_53021"><em>"This is how we do it: always use fresh water, pour it over the tea bag while it's still boiling and allow to brew for 2-4 minutes. The rest is up to you"</em></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_53025">A reasonable brewing time and though I usually favour stronger tea I have enjoyed this brewed both slowly and quickly. A quick brew will bring out more lemon flavour than a slow one will.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_53028"><strong>Colour</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_53037">Very pale green, hard to see in my usual </p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_53047"><strong>Aroma</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_53051">The lemon smell is not particularly strong when you remove the tea bag from the packaging but when you make the tea it is very fragrant indeed. You must enjoy lemons to enjoy this tea.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_53054"><strong>Taste</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_53058">This is a very refreshing tea and has quickly become my staple at work in this warm weather. If you brew it quickly the tea takes a back seat and you get a lovely, lemony libation. With a longer brewing time you get a nice green tea with hints of lemon. This is definitely the tea I would suggest to someone who hasn't tried green tea before!</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_53061"><strong>Work &amp; Music</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_53065">This tea has been an excellent pick-me-up this week with an increased work load. I have also been accompanying it with a variety of good music including Marc Bolan &amp; T-Rex and some comedy from "Weird Al" Yankovic (currently </p>
