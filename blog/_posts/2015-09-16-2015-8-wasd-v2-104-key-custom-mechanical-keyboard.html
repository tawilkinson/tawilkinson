<p><em>In which I receive my keyboard...</em></p>
<p>In my <a href="/blog/2015/7/building-a-better-keyboard">previous post</a> I discussed designing my shiny new keyboard. Now that it has arrived it's time to review my first month with it.</p>
<h2>Look</h2>

<p>LOOK AT IT!</p>
<p>Ahem, I mean isn't it shiny?* The full colour printing turned out much better than I expected. Also the coloured keycaps matched what I wanted perfectly. The sleek black of the rest of the keyboard looks very nice on my desk too.</p>
<p>*<span style="font-size:16px">And I don't just mean the reflection of the office lights in the photos.</span></p>
<h2>Feel</h2>
  
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3WvlPz1Zso" target="_blank"><img src="/squarespace_images/static_55801e15e4b00ddc71aed22b_5582d68ce4b0c39562640bcf_55f9e255e4b00b2feb738194_1442439770317_cherymxbrown.gif_" alt=""></a>
  

<p>The Cherry MX Browns are very responsive and frankly it is a dream to type with. Since this is my first mechanical I imagine quite a bit of this is just due to the superior build quality and having proper keys for once.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wasdkeyboards.com/">WASD</a>, however, were brilliant to deal with and sent me a replacement switch when I briefly had an issue.<span style="font-size:16px">†</span> I cannot recommend them enough.</p>
<p>The buttons feel very nice to the touch and as my touch typing improves it is like I am one with my laptop in a way I never was before.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px">†This was actually a software issue due to changing the language on Windows. Silly Windows.</span></p>
<h2>The Learning Curve</h2>
<p>The hardware switch on the bottom of the keyboard activates a hardware <a target="_blank" href="https://colemak.com/">Colemak</a> mode. This means I only needed to change the language to US in Windows.<span style="font-size:16px">‡</span> For us Brits you can use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a> to add in the £ symbol on the 3 key.</p>
<p>So the first week I probably averaged about 10 words per minute. That isn't good for a work environment, especially a coding one. Thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tipp10.com/en/">Tipp 10</a> I have improved greatly. Firstly, I now don't have to look at the keyboard...most of the time. Secondly, my speed is up to 21 WPM with a 3% error rate. I still need to speed up but the occasional furtive glance at the keyboard helps me get by for now.</p>
