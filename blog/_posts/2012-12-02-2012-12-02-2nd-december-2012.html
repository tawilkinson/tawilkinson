<p><em>In which the elfs and I investigate the publicity of Medi</em>æ<em>val Bæbes...</em></p>
<p>Today's song is the classic Gaudete which you may well know the Steeleye Span version of. Here is the version performed by the Mediæval Bæbes:</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_454653">I think their album covers show an obvious change in publicity tactics. For example here's their first album, Salva Nos, which is where Gaudete is from:</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_443922">A cover which definitely fits with the medieval theme of their music. Their next album then features the artists themselves:</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_443928">Apparently slowly dissolving into the curtains. Then their publicity guy went "Hey they're all women, let's put them in nicer dresses":</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_443934">Which was followed by the noughties hitting them suddenly:</p>
  
      <img src="/squarespace_images/static_55801e15e4b00ddc71aed22b_5582d68ce4b0c39562640bcf_5a8eee1c8165f55c5c30f6e6_1519316513179_mirabilis.jpg_" alt="">
  

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_443940">Where they look like an extended cast of Charmed. Then the publicity guy clearly came back with "We need sexy dresses and lighting!":</p>
  
      <img src="/squarespace_images/static_55801e15e4b00ddc71aed22b_5582d68ce4b0c39562640bcf_5a8eee48419202cfad8967f6_1519316556634_illumination.jpg_" alt="">
  

<p>Then they went all out on the photoshoot:</p>
  
       <img src="/squarespace_images/static_55801e15e4b00ddc71aed22b_5582d68ce4b0c39562640bcf_5a8eeea0419202cfad898203_1519316644877_mediaevalbaebes1-largest.jpg_" alt="Explosions!"> Explosions! 
  

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_443956">While it would be cool to think that the new marketing is due to them being assured women I expect it was a male advertising exec who came up with the idea. Maybe men just don't like medieval songs in general and the need to push into the market?</p>
