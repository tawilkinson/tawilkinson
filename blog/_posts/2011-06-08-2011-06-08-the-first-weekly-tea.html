<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_130443">The idea of me presenting my tea of the week was suggested at my birthday party last month. Since I am always happy to oblige in such endeavours I am going to start a weekly tea review blog :D</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_130446">So this weeks tea is Whittard's Loose Leaf Sticky Toffee Pudding Flavoured Tea (currently 25% off in their Manchester store). It sounded crazy so I simply had to try it.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_130451"><strong>Brewing: </strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_130455"><strong><em>"</em></strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_130460"><em>Always drink lightly brewed with 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of leaves per 6-cup pot. Boil freshly drawn water, warm the pot first with a splash of hot water. Add the tea and pour on boiling water. Brew for 2-5 minutes. Do not add milk."</em></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_130466">Brewing the tea is straightforward but it should be enjoyed without milk. I personally think that brewing this tea for 5 minutes is best to really get a strong aroma.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_130471"><strong>Colour:</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_130475"> A traditional light brown tea colour</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_130480"><strong>Aroma: </strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_130484">It does exactly what it says on the tin! Just open the packet and take a long deep breath to truly get that sticky toffee pudding smell in your nostrils. A wonderful treat :)</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_130489"><strong>Taste: </strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_130493">I had no idea what to expect when tasting this tea, would it go down like syrup? Well disappointingly it tastes like normal tea (but with the amazing smell described above). However, I feel this is probably for the best as I don't know as if I could drink an entire cup of sticky toffee syrup (this is a lie, I totally could but probably shouldn't). These sentiments were also expressed by those who tasted the tea with me, so we have a consensus.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_130498"><strong>Conclusion: </strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436547490367_130502">Nice tea taste, amazing smell. Warming and lovely.</p>
