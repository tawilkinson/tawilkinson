<p><em>In which I get a free tea with my pumpkin and ginger cake from Graze...</em></p>
<p>I recently got a few free Graze boxes and they send you a small piece of cake with complimentary tea :)</p>
<h3>Brewing</h3>
<p><em>"A blend of assam and kenyan leaves."</em></p>
<p>There were no instructions so I used my usual 5 minutes brewing time and added a little milk.</p>
<h3>Colour</h3>
<p>Lighter than my standard teas but still a light brown, tea colour.</p>
<h3>Aroma</h3>
<p>There is a hint of bergamot but the predominant aroma is that of black tea.</p>
<h3>Taste</h3>
<p>This is a very pleasant blend. Perhaps it's a gateway tea to those who don't currently like Earl Grey as it tastes like normal tea with a hint of bergamot. It is very refreshing and a great way to start the afternoon. The fact that it comes packaged with cake doesn't harm it either!</p>
<h3>BII Showcase</h3>
<p>This week I attended the 4th annual <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bii.manchester.ac.uk/Showcase2012/">Biomedical Imaging Institute Showcase</a>. It was very interesting to see new MR applications and to see a study that I was a subject in being presented. Also I managed to get the annual free mug, which of course I can now use to drink tea!</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>A refreshing afternoon blend which comes with a cake :) Lovely.</p>
<p>I know I've said this before but I think I may soon change the layout of my tea reviews as they are getting a little repetitive :S</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_43553"><em>This week it is time for the king of the Christmas sandwiches IMHO - the M&amp;S sandwich! Will it retain it's crown?</em></p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_43557">Price: £3.00</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_43560">Taste: The stuffing is very tasty, you can taste the sage &amp; onion. A small amount of mayonnaise makes the sandwich moist enough without overpowering. It could do with a bit more cranberry sauce but when you get a whole cranberry it is splendid. The turkey has a lot of flavour as opposed to in the others to date where it was indistinguishable from chicken.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436546053698_43563">Conclusion: Still excellent and the best so far. Will another sandwich topple it in the following weeks?</p>
