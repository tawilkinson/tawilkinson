<p><em>In which I look into the required gear...</em></p>
<p>So far I’ve only been able to internet shop for my costume but these are my preliminary ideas.</p>
<h3>Coat</h3>
<p>The full replica coat is around $350 (plus shipping to the UK) so that’s out of the question. Currently I’m looking at something like this:</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_124643">This is cheap £25 but I’ll have to look at one in person to see if it looks any good. Then I’ll have to edit it a bit to get it looking right.</p>
<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_124646">Trousers</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_124649">I’m currently thinking I will just wear a pair of chinos higher than usual (held up by braces).</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_124652">The braces in the show are Israeli Army H Braces:</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_124658">These are cheap if you can find them. If I can’t I’ll have to look into normal beige braces.</p>
<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_124661">Shirt</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_124664">I’ve found quite a few wine or burgundy coloured shirts online such as:</p>
  
       <img src="/squarespace_images/static_55801e15e4b00ddc71aed22b_5582d68ce4b0c39562640bcf_5649bd9ce4b02d8d6e27e241_1447673245221__img.jpg_" alt="From Debenhams"> From Debenhams 
  

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_124670">These are quite (one is around £12) reasonable and actually could be worn casually without the costume :)</p>
<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_124673">Pistol</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_124676">The pistol in the show is unique (except for very expensive replicas). I’m thinking of getting a cheap toy revolver then sticking some bits to it. Afterwards I’ll paint it bronze and hopefully it’ll look the part.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_124679">The holster should be fairly easy as online there are lots of these available quite cheaply:</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_124685">And as for a belt to hold the holster up? I think I already have something suitable :)</p>
<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_124688">Boots</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_124691">Currently I own some ‘pirate boots’ which cover your shoes. Next weekend, however, I think I’ll go look around the Northern Quarter looking at second hand shops. If I spot anything good then I might buy those as well.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_124694">This party is well over a month away but I’m already looking forward to it! :)</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436538236407_124697">Tom Out!</p>
