<p><em>In which I belatedly start on my advent calendar...</em></p>
<p>Let me spin you a tale, dear Reader, of being in the wrong place at the wrong time and stock control. Don't worry it isn't <em>that</em> boring. I was sadly on a last minute business trip last week which means I missed the opportunity to purchase an advent calendar. I figured that I would be able to get an interesting and different one in the States but alas I was wrong. I also figured that I would be able to pick up a discounted one in a UK supermarket on the 2nd after I landed but alas Tesco's stock control meant they didn't even have an awful one left!</p>
<p>I had basically resigned myself to not finding one this year.</p>
<p>On Saturday I popped into London with some friends and thought that I might as well keep an eye out, you know, just in case. Having decided to pop into Harrods to perhaps by tea I came across an advent calendar in the wild. Sadly it was £25 and no matter how great the chocolate that is a bit pricey. Oh well, no advent calendar this year. Mere minutes after resigning myself, yet again, to an advent calendar-less future we happened upon this:</p>

<p>It was going for only £6.50 in the end.</p>
<p>As I'm behind I'm going to review 3 teas today, 2 tomorrow then get back into a proper one-a-day advent schedule.</p>
<h1>#1 - Chocolate Orange</h1>

</div>
<p><strong>Tea Style:</strong> Rooibos.</p>
<p><strong>Flavours: </strong>Cocoa nibs, orange peel, cloves, cinnamon, chicory.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Can't really taste or smell the chocolate. The orange flavour is there though. Pleasant but also not that festive.</p>
<h1>#2 - Christmas Candy</h1>
  
      <img src="/squarespace_images/static_55801e15e4b00ddc71aed22b_5582d68ce4b0c39562640bcf_58446f60725e25d0d2b41832_1480879980856_tea_2.jpgtea_2_" alt="">
  

<p><strong>Tea Style:</strong> Green.</p>
<p><strong>Flavours:</strong> Cinnamon, peppermint, orange peel, chicory, cocoa nibs, vanilla.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> I'm not sure about the last four flavours as the peppermint really dominates. The cinnamon adds a lovely spicy burn to it that definitely adds a warming feeling. Overall lovely and pretty festive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<h1>#3 - Christmas Pudding</h1>
  
      <img src="/squarespace_images/static_55801e15e4b00ddc71aed22b_5582d68ce4b0c39562640bcf_5844707744024382e465d12a_1480880257633_tea_3.jpgtea_3_" alt="">
  

<p><strong>Tea Style:</strong> Rooibos.</p>
<p><strong>Flavours:</strong> Ginger, nutmeg, raisins, cinnamon, cranberries.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Again I'm not sure this really evokes the taste it is supposed to. That being said it is much more festive than the first tea. The spices do come through and it is more reminiscent of a watery mulled wine.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>More advent teas coming in the lead up to Christmas...</p>
