<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1434658538515_11196">Data? I 'ardly know 'er!</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1434658538515_11199">In a break from continuous Thesis writing I have recently been running another imaging experiment. This was, as you could expect, a fairly hectic few weeks with early mornings and late nights. It was, however, much better than the weeks following where I am now stuck with the unenviable task of analysing image after image in ImageJ. Regardless of your research area this is the boring part of a PhD - repeatedly doing the same thing over and over again. Hopefully there is light at the end of the tunnel though and this will be my final experiment - Great Success!</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1434658538515_11202">Now all I have to do is finish writing an 80,000 word thesis...</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1434658538515_11209">Normally putting cold water on a tea bag is likely to cause some comment in the break room*. It might even incite full on tea based rage along the lines of "What the HELL do you think you're doing!?".  This is, however, precisely the method required to make Lipton's Sun Tea. After leaving the bag to brew for 4 minutes† you can choose to add an ice cube or two to make it even colder and more refreshing.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1434658538515_11212">As for taste - these are essentially Lipton Ice Tea bags but without the sugar. It's a pleasant black tea blended with lemon flavouring and tastes similar to their ice tea. It's very refreshing and a good break if your have a hot and stuffy office or are enjoying summer. You probably won;t enjoy these if you're not already a fan of ice tea.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1434658538515_11215">I've never seen another tea like this so if you have drop me a link in the comments please!</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1434658538515_11218">*I definitely garnered some odd looks as I put a normal looking pyramid bag into my tea mug and proceed to drown it in cold water.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1434658538515_11221">†I found I needed to brew it for slightly longer than the 4 minutes as my mug is larger than the 200 ml suggested.</p>
<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1434658538515_11224">Steampunk Tony Stark</h3>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1434658538515_11227">After quite a hiatus my next <a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55397e91e4b0061c5889b3f0/556839abe4b0d9163c0ffd27/55683acce4b0d9163c102f6f/1432894156379/?format=original" target="_blank">Tailor</a> project is upon me. I am going to an upcoming Victorian Steampunk themed <a href="http://ssagorally.org.uk/ball" target="_blank">Ball</a> and I am intending to go as a Steampunked version of Tony Stark. Stay tuned for details! In the meantime here are some awesome images of Steampunk Avengers I've found online:</p>
