<p>My friend Mike and I are starting a new podcast coming to you on a bi-weekly basis.</p>
<p>The podcast is going to cover a wide range of topics with the next week's topic being pulled randomly out of a hat at the end of each episode. Once we are up and running the topic suggestions will be open to our audience to add variety (though we have about 10 or so at the moment).</p>
<p>Here's our logo as a teaser:</p>
