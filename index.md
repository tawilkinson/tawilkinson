Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I [blog](http://tinkertailorsoldiersponge.com), [vlog](https://www.youtube.com/user/wyl2km), [write](/author) and [do science](/cv)!

This site is my home on the web and points to my various projects around the internet and in real life. Enjoy!

# Scientist
## Research Fellow
I am currently a Research Fellow at [King's College London](/cv/2020/kcl.html). I am part of the core physics team on the [LoCUS](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/bmeis/research-impact/research-facilities) Ultra-High Field MRI system. You can find my univerity profile on the [KCL website](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/thomas-wilkinson).

## PhD
I have completed a PhD in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at the [University of Manchester](/cv/2014/university-of-manchester.html).

If you are interested in my research you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tawilkinson/).

## Physicist
I attended Warwick University from 2007-2010 reading Physics. I achieved a Second-class honours, upper division (2:1) B.Sc.

I concentrated on modules related to C programming, astrophysics, medical imaging and magnetic resonance.

# Blogger
## Tinker Tailor Soldier Sponge
I blog about tech ([Tinker](http://www.tinkertailorsoldiersponge.com/?category=Tinker)), costumes ([Tailor](http://www.tinkertailorsoldiersponge.com/?category=Tailor)), airsofting ([Soldier](http://www.tinkertailorsoldiersponge.com/?category=Soldier)) and baking ([Sponge](http://www.tinkertailorsoldiersponge.com/?category=Sponge)).

### [Tinker](http://www.tinkertailorsoldiersponge.com/?category=Tinker)

I like to tinker with Linux, LaTeX and Windows.

You'll find guides on inserting equations into Word documents correctly, generating MR pulse sequence diagrams in LaTeX, setting up a media server and the like.

### [Tailor](http://www.tinkertailorsoldiersponge.com/?category=Tailor)

I semi-regularly go to events in fancy dress.

For the most part this section covers the time I dressed up as Thor but new content will be coming soon.

### [Soldier](http://www.tinkertailorsoldiersponge.com/?category=Soldier)

I am an airsofter though I don't get to go as often as I'd like. There will be more content coming in future.

### [Sponge](http://www.tinkertailorsoldiersponge.com/?category=Sponge)

I enjoy baking and making interesting cakes.

Stop by for MRI scanner cakes, giant versions of famous biscuits and anything else I put my mind to baking!

### The Rest

I also write about my [PhD](http://www.tinkertailorsoldiersponge.com/?category=PhD) and review [teas](http://www.tinkertailorsoldiersponge.com/?category=Tea)!
