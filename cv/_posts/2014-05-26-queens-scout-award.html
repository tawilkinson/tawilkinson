<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Scout">Queen's Scout Award</a> is the highest award a youth member can achieve in scouting and must be completed before your 25th birthday. The QSA requires you to fulfill
  requirements in the following sections:</p>

<h3>Nights Away</h3>
<p>I have completed over 200 Nights Away during my time in scouting.</p>
<h3>International, Environment &amp; Values</h3>
<p>I attended and helped run a week long camp at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.burg-rieneck.de/en/">Rieneck Scout Castle</a>, Germany for my International requirement.</p>
<p>I helped my scout group obtain their Faith activity badge for my Values requirement.</p>
<h3>Challenge</h3>
