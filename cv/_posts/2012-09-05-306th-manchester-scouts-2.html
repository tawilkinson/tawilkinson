<h3>Assistant Cub Scout Leader 2011-12</h3>
<p>I was an ACSL at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.306th.org.uk/">306th Manchester Scouts</a> for 12 months. I have since restarted the Scout section.</p>
<h3>Camping</h3>
<p>As ACSL I took the Cubs on the following camps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whitsun Camp 2013</li>
<li>Family Camp 2012</li>
<li>GME Jubilee Camp 2012</li>
</ul>
